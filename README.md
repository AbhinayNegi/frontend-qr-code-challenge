## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS

### What I learned

Setting margin-left: auto; and margin-right: auto; instructs the browser to distribute the available space within the containing element equally on both sides of the element. This effectively centers the element horizontally relative to its container, not necessarily the entire screen.

I also learned that if an element has padding applied lets say 20px on all side and if we also apply the border-radius to less than 20px we might not see the rounded corners of that element because, The reason is that the rounded corners are created within the element's border box, which includes padding. If the border-radius is smaller than the padding, the curves fall entirely within the padding and become invisible. Increasing the border-radius allows the curvature to extend beyond the padding and become visually apparent.

### Continued development

I still want to learn more about layout and positioning of the elements. I also want to improve my knowlege about the responsive design.
